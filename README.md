# Space Invaders

A cool little space shooter game where you have to kill aliens until their boss gets angry and pays you a visit.

Move your ship left and right, shoot your laser, avoid getting hit by enemy projectiles, as you only have one hit point.

Each time you kill a ship there is a chance it will drop a power up that enhances your combat abilities (a shield that gives you an extra life in case you get hit and enhanced lasers that let you shoot three bolts at once).

Word of your brave exploits travels fast, so once you clear all the enemy ships a boss enemy will spawn and you will have to take down its massive health bar in order to win the game.

After you kill a certain number of enemies one of them will separate from the group and descend on a more aggressive Bezier path with increased rate of fire.

I also implemented a scrolling background and some missiles that travel on a Bezier curve just to try some new things out.
